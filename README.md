# <Justin Lymans Prework study guide README>

## Description

This project is the first step in learning about the world and industry of devolpment. The reason I mad this project is because it was a good chance to dip my toe in the water of code. It solves the issue of me as a student not having an oganized space for all the notes and information that I have the chance to learn through this course work.

## Usage

This prework study guide can be used as a reference to information about HTML, CSS,  and JavaScript. This live site will be the hub for my notes about all these topics. There's a solid benefit doing it this way as all my information is in an organized and centeralized local. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
